# ft_printf
This project is an implementation of the printf built in command 

This project implements the functionality of the built in command printf.
This project is handling the following conversions:
- %s (string)

- %d (decimal)
- %p (pointer)
- %x (lower case hexadecimal)
- %X (upper case hexadecimal)

, Also a main file is uploaded to check, test and compare my project conversions to the main printf built in command output to display the result similarities.

To run this project please follow the following steps:

1 - make

3 - ./a.out

I hope that this project will benefit you by gaining sufficient information.
