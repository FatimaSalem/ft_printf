It's an implementation of the printf built in command.

The following converions are handled in this project:
- %s (string)
- %u (unsigned decimal)
- %i (integer)
- %d (decimal)
- %p (pointer)
- %x (lower case hexadecimal)
- %X (upper case hexadecimal)
- %c (character)
- %% (percentage)

, Also a main file is uploaded to check, test and compare my project conversions to the main printf built in command output to display the result similarities.
