# ft_printf
This project is an implementation of the printf built in command.

The following converions are handled in this project:
- %s (string)
- %u (unsigned decimal)
- %i (integer)
- %d (decimal)
- %p (pointer)
- %x (lower case hexadecimal)
- %X (upper case hexadecimal)
- %c (character)
- %% (percentage)

, Also a main file is uploaded to check, test and compare my project conversions to the main printf built in command output to display the result similarities.

To run this project please follow the following steps:

- make
- gcc *.c
- ./a.out

I hope that this project will benefit you by gaining sufficient information.
